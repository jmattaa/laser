## I Have a Question

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing 
[Issues](https://github.com/jmattaa/laser/issues) that might help you. 
In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, 
you can write your question in this issue.

If you then still feel the need to ask a 
question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/jmattaa/laser/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

## I Want To Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more 
information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect 
information and describe the issue in detail in your report.
Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug 
as fast as possible.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for laser, 
**including completely new features and minor improvements to existing 
functionality**. 

#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Perform a [search](https://github.com/jmattaa/laser/issues) to see 
if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the 
existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's 
up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the 
merits of this feature. Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful 
to the majority of our users and not just a small subset. 

#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as 
[GitHub issues](https://github.com/jmattaa/laser/issues).

- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as 
many details as possible.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected 
to see instead** and why. 
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most laser users. You may 
also want to point out the other projects that solved it better and which could 
serve as inspiration.
